                <p class="text-3xl pb-10 font-extrabold tracking-wide">About e-KMS servers</p>
                <p class="text-md md:text-xl font-normal tracking-wide pb-10">Microsoft KMS is a piece of software, that when inputed with a company mass-activation license, can allow computers inside the company network to connect and obtain activation, without needing to connect to the internet or microsoft verfication servers, the software is closed-source, usually runs on a company's (windows powered) server and has cryptographic trickery to prevent use without a expensive mass-activation license. The Microsoft KMS server-side software got entirely reverse-enginereed and decompiled by CODYQX4, and since then, using the blueprints, people were able to create emulated KMS servers that are entirely open-source and don't require any sort of license. Since this software is used a LOT by comapnies and legacy systems worldwide, usually on internal networks, microsoft can't update it, so thus this exploit was born. This step simply forcefully sets the KMS server address inside the SLMGR (software lincense manager, admin priv required) to a emulated free one, either a public or a self-hosted one. This has no effect on the system and does not change/crack anything on your pc.</p>
                <p class="text-md md:text-xl font-normal tracking-wide pb-10">PSA: kms licenses are only valid for 6 months (to ensure companies dont cancel their subscriptions after activating their computers), but can be renewed indefinetly, windows does this license refresh in the background every few months or so, so make sure your e-KMS server of choice can be accesed. Obviously by connecting to the e-KMS server. your IP can be seen, the same as websites can see your IP, which is why I recommended self-hosting a e-KMS server or using a trusted one, but your IP is basically public to everywebsite or app you use, and contrary to popular belief, it is meant to be public and does not contain any compromising info about you. xoxo</p>
